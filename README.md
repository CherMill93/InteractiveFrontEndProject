# InteractiveFrontEndProject

This project was created by, Chris rock, Steven spielberg and some rando named omar.
The purpose of this project is to protray a work flow between collegues and instruct us on how to communicate and collate with others to further expand our knowlegde and provide a fully functional application.

We have created a fun project that is used for gamers, specifically Apex legends gamers.
They can use this app to list basic stats to show them what they lack or need to improve. 

-added functions to the app include previous searchs being saved into an array, and as well a search for twitch streamers to view their view count!
